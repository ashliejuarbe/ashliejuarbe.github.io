			<p>The New School collects almost 8,000 pounds of waste everyday. With over 10,000 students walking in and out of the New School campus, the average person produces around tk lbs of trash.</p>
			<p onmouseover="highlight()" onmouseout="returnNormal()">The Making Center on the second floor of 2 W 13th St. has the woodshop, 3D print machines, sewing machines, knitting machines, and craft tables. It is one of the biggest contributors of waste at The New School. Some students in that space had concerns when it came to handling their waste. <strong>Caroline Adamy</strong>, a first-year student, said <strong>“certain plastic that are contaminated can’t be recycled.” Christi Ernest</strong>, a product design fourth-year student, asked <strong>“what do I do with food waste?” Wen Yi</strong>, a first-year student, wondered if <strong>“paper cups go to landfill or paper recycling.”</strong></p>

			<h3>Who can the students ask when they have these questions?</h3>
			<h3 class="special">The Tishman Center.</h3>
			<br>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p>The Tishman Center is at the center of sustainability efforts at The New School. Ana Baptista, the Associate Director at the Tishman Center, said the center’s priority is to educate students and faculty on being a “climate citizen” through an engagement plan.</p>
			<p onmouseover="highlight()" onmouseout="returnNormal()">There are 116 countries represented within The New School student body. The Tishman Center wants all of those students to have a basic understanding of sustainability.<strong> “Students come with a varying degree of awareness and passions,” said Molly Johnson</strong>, the University Sustainability Associate. The center hosts public sustainability events like conferences, guest panels, orientation activities, and town hall meetings, but many of these events draw crowds who are already interested in sustainability. A challenge for the Tishman Center is educating students who haven’t sought out information for themselves.</p>
			<p>One of the ways the Tishman Center educates its audience about sustainability is through signs that are supposed to help people sort their trash.</p>
			<p>Part of their engagement plan was redesigning the trash sign - they wanted to make the signs easier to follow. In 2016, the team spent nine-months on a redesign, ultimately creating the five signs you see around campus: indicating landfill; paper; glass, plastic, metal, and cartons; batteries, and composting. The designers who worked on the signs thought better visual representations would help people make better decisions about their trash.</p>

			<h3>But if students still have questions,</h3>
			<h3 class="special">where is the disconnect?</h3>
			<br>
		</div>

			<p>The university campus is spread across 37 buildings. But The New School only has control over 13 of those locations. Erik Eibert, The New School Buildings Manager, said that The New School does not own a lot of buildings. That makes it difficult to control the use of resources like electricity, water, and heat. </p>

			<p onmouseover="highlight()" onmouseout="returnNormal()">The Tishman Center has trash data from 17 locations. The types of trash collected are Landfill, e-Waste, Composting, and Recycled Materials. From all the pounds of trash the buildings collect, <strong>45%</strong> of it goes to recycling, according to the data from Eibert.</p>
			<p onmouseover="highlight()" onmouseout="returnNormal()">2 W 13th St. and University Center are where most of the trash is collected. Combined, they contribute <strong>40%</strong> of The New School trash.</p>
			<p>The Tishman Center has several ways of encouraging people to recycle, and of making the school practice sustainability. That includes projects like climate disruption week, where the Tishman Center dimslights and reduces elevator service to lower electricity consumption in the UC, or public events like the Zero Waste Conference that cover recycling and composting. The smallest interpersonal practice is asking students - through signs and fliers - to use reusable bottles, and dispose of waste correctly like the new trash signs say.</p>
			<p onmouseover="highlight()" onmouseout="returnNormal()">In 2 W 13th., <strong>42%</strong> of its trash is recycled materials, for the University Center, that number drops to <strong>20%</strong>. Recycling is the lowest form of collected trash because of “improper waste separation and because we can’t recycle everything.” Eibert also says we have a high recycling rate compared to other schools.</p>
			<p>Extension, a waste management program at University of Wisconsin, measures effective engagement strategies in changing student’s behavior around trash disposal. In a 2014 study, Extension stated ”print sources can be effective but work better in combination with other strategies.” RecycleMania agreed, saying “informational programs, such as those based on simply handing out pamphlets or posting flyers, have a low likelihood of influencing behavior.”</p>
			<p>Johnson understands that there are different strategies to get engagement, but since the Tishman Center launched in 2015, the main goal is to be a presence on campus.</p>
			<p onmouseover="highlight()" onmouseout="returnNormal()"><strong>“The longer we are around, the more recognition we’ll have,”</strong> says Johnson, <strong>“We are early in our game. I’d like to get to a point where sustainability is a university wide learning outcome.”</strong> The Tishman Center hopes to achieve this by working with each school at The New School to weave sustainability into each department.</p>
